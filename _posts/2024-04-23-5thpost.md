# Playing with Math tools

In this blog post, I am playing around with the latex language to write complex math equations. Latex is a beautiful tool to write aestheitcally pleasing electronic documents.  

$$
\sum_{i} (n)
$$

$$
\int_{k} (x)
$$

$$
\gamma = \frac{24*\exp{24x}}{\beta}
$$

Overleaf has given me an advantage to knowing the latex language, but being able to use this in my Github blogs is also very handy to potentially present my knowledge and findings with accompany mathematical equations.
